This is a modification of the original Wiixplorer, adding support for Wii U Pro Controllers.

It does not build with devkitPPC r45, and I have no plans on fixing it. I'm just creating this repo for archival purposes.

Credits:
* Dimok789 (and others) for writing Wiixplorer
* FIX94 for writing libWUPC, which gave us the ability to use the WUPC with Wii Homebrews.
